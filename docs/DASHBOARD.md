# Release-trust dashboard — ssm-foundations

At-a-glance scoreboard of per-chapter artifact completeness and verification state.
The at-a-glance complement to the deeper audit capability (see
`audits/2026-06-04_ecosystem_checkpoint.md` §4). Hand-maintained; refresh the
artifact columns with the snippet at the bottom and reconcile `status:` by eye.

**Verified:** 2026-06-13 (post Ch-17 ship — **the book is content-complete (M6)**: the synthesis
crown-jewel authored vertical — JAX + a stdlib Julia symplectic cross-check (no torch by design),
two figures, four review subagents; two integration demos composing the book's instruments — a
symplectic *atlas cell* (Ch 6 + 10) and a two-timescale *disentanglement pipeline* (Ch 14 + 15 + 16)
— run on idealized systems as the reproducible templates the C1/B pilots fill with trained-model
data. All 17 chapters now `implemented` + deployed).

## Trust notes

- **Ch 1–17** are `implemented`: prose + exercises + companions authored, `make check` (content gates +
  bibkey/xref lint) green, companion suites green, deployed. JAX is the canonical reference for every
  chapter; **torch parity is complete for ch01–16** (ch04–10 backfilled via the Ch-11 runway; **ch01–03's
  literal torch↔jax cross-checks added in Stage 2 PR A** — the runway had left them validated against
  analytic/library oracles, scipy `expm` / `torch.linalg.matrix_exp` — closing 0527-F27; ch11–16
  authored with parity from the start). **Ch 17 ships JAX + Julia only — no torch by
  design** (a synthesis chapter that *composes* existing JAX instruments introduces no new kernel to port).
- **Julia is a selective track, not a universal gate** — present where the chapter's numerical core
  warrants a cross-language check (ch04 via `DifferentialEquations.jl`; ch05–07, ch10–13, ch15, and ch17 stdlib-only —
  ch13's cross-checks the exponential-gate stabilizer, ch15's the QR-Lyapunov diagnostic, ch17's the C1 symplectic
  atlas cell's energy conservation, the C1 pilot's atlas being itself Julia); absent by design elsewhere (ch14 and ch16
  are filtering linear algebra + counting — JAX+torch only, per their briefs). A `—` in the Julia column is *not* a gap.
- **`claim-skeptic` (added 2026-06-04) has now been run on all of Ch 1–17.** As a forward gate it covered
  Ch 11–17 as authored (on Ch 17 confirming the two integration signatures are genuinely new and the
  TC⁰-bounded provisional verdict; on Ch 15 all three propositions + the cited-not-proven boundary; on
  Ch 13 the three propositions against the NXAI xLSTM reference; on Ch 16 all four propositions + the
  expected-vs-realized excess-CE distinction). The **retroactive Ch 1–10 sweep ran 2026-06-13** as Stage 1
  of the post-M6 beta gate (`audits/2026-06-13_post-m6_recheck.md`): 42 findings — including genuine math
  errors (a false Jordan-block-size formula, a self-contradictory ZOH modulus claim, an explicit-RK
  trilemma against the chapter's own theorem) and misattributions (HiPPO conditioning miscited to a paper
  proving no such result) — remediated across PRs #32–#35 + close-out and re-verified clean. **The Ch 1–10
  rows now reflect a claim-skeptic review.**
- **All 17 chapters are `implemented` and deployed — the book is content-complete (M6).** The post-M6
  **Stage 1 beta gate** — Ch 1–10 hardening (the retroactive `claim-skeptic` sweep + 2026-05-27-audit
  remediation + a STYLE §8 refresh) — is **complete**. **Stage 2** (tooling/CI + the toolkit re-bump):
  **PR A landed the tooling items** — #26 (content-validating `status-check`, which on its first run
  caught a real Stage-1 `STATUS.md` drift), ch04-Julia folded into the default loop (F7/#4), and ch01–03
  torch↔jax parity (F27) — and **PR B** re-bumped the toolkit v4.16.0 → 4.23.0, landing **#126**
  (theorem headings auto-number to match `<XRef>`) + **#135** (the sidebar subtitle, closing **#14**);
  the open #140/#141 base-link bugs are confirmed not to affect this root-deployed book. **Stage 2 is
  complete.** Remaining post-M6 work is the readiness-gated **M7** (fold C1/B pilot results into
  Ch 15/16/17 and flip `alpha → beta`).

Verification commands behind the columns: `make check` (CI gate), `make companion-jax-tests`,
`make companion-torch-tests`, `make companion-julia-tests` (local-only; need the uv `.venv`).
