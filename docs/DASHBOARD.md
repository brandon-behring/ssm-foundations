# Release-trust dashboard — ssm-foundations

At-a-glance scoreboard of per-chapter artifact completeness and verification state.
The at-a-glance complement to the deeper audit capability (see
`audits/2026-06-04_ecosystem_checkpoint.md` §4). Hand-maintained; refresh the
artifact columns with the snippet at the bottom and reconcile `status:` by eye.

**Verified:** 2026-06-13 (post Ch-13 ship: exponential gates and matrix memory authored
vertical — JAX + torch + a stdlib Julia stabilizer module, three figures, four review
subagents; the generalized diagonal-plus-rank-one transition unifying RWKV-7 and xLSTM,
extending the Ch 12 lineage to matrix memories with their own stability questions).

**Legend.** ✓ present/passing · — absent · `Tests` = JAX *and* torch pytest suites present and green
(`make companion-jax-tests` / `companion-torch-tests`) · `Figs` = committed PNGs under `public/figures/chNN/`
· `Live` = chapter content deployed at <https://ssm-foundations.brandon-behring.dev> (`stub` = PreReleaseBanner only).

## Trust notes

- **Ch 1–14 and 16** are `implemented`: prose + exercises + companions authored, `make check` (content gates +
  bibkey/xref lint) green, companion suites green, deployed. JAX is the canonical reference for every
  chapter; **torch parity is complete for ch01–14 and ch16** (ch01–10 backfilled via the Ch-11 runway, closing
  0527-F27; ch11–14 and ch16 authored with parity from the start).
- **Julia is a selective track, not a universal gate** — present where the chapter's numerical core
  warrants a cross-language check (ch04 via `DifferentialEquations.jl`; ch05–07 and ch10–13 stdlib-only —
  ch13's cross-checks the exponential-gate stabilizer's log-domain overflow control); absent by design
  elsewhere (ch14 and ch16 are filtering linear algebra + counting — JAX+torch only, per their briefs).
  A `—` in the Julia column is *not* a gap.
- **`claim-skeptic` is new (2026-06-04)** and has **not** been run retroactively on Ch 1–10; its adversarial
  math-claim pass is a forward gate (exercised on Ch 11–14 and 16; on Ch 13 it verified all three
  propositions against the authoritative NXAI xLSTM reference implementation, and on Ch 16 it confirmed all four
  propositions and drove the expected-vs-realized excess-CE distinction, a previously nonexistent
  companion check being added, and attribution tightenings — Zoology's recall-gap finding, the
  §14.5 axis-differentiation claim), so the Ch 1–10 rows do not yet reflect a claim-skeptic review.
- **Ch 15 and 17** are `planned` stubs (no original prose/companions); the deployed pages show only the
  pre-release banner.

Verification commands behind the columns: `make check` (CI gate), `make companion-jax-tests`,
`make companion-torch-tests`, `make companion-julia-tests` (local-only; need the uv `.venv`).
