# Release-trust dashboard — ssm-foundations

At-a-glance scoreboard of per-chapter artifact completeness and verification state.
The at-a-glance complement to the deeper audit capability (see
`audits/2026-06-04_ecosystem_checkpoint.md` §4). Hand-maintained; refresh the
artifact columns with the snippet at the bottom and reconcile `status:` by eye.

**Verified:** 2026-06-11 (post Ch-16 ship: empirical methodology authored vertical —
JAX+torch companions, four figures, four review subagents; the second pilot-B anchor,
closing B's book-side prerequisites: the eval-protocol stack, the composite predictor,
and the probe-signature method).

**Legend.** ✓ present/passing · — absent · `Tests` = JAX *and* torch pytest suites present and green
(`make companion-jax-tests` / `companion-torch-tests`) · `Figs` = committed PNGs under `public/figures/chNN/`
· `Live` = chapter content deployed at <https://ssm-foundations.brandon-behring.dev> (`stub` = PreReleaseBanner only).

## Trust notes

- **Ch 1–12, 14, and 16** are `implemented`: prose + exercises + companions authored, `make check` (content gates +
  bibkey/xref lint) green, companion suites green, deployed. JAX is the canonical reference for every
  chapter; **torch parity is complete for ch01–12, ch14, and ch16** (ch01–10 backfilled via the Ch-11 runway, closing
  0527-F27; ch11–12, ch14, and ch16 authored with parity from the start).
- **Julia is a selective track, not a universal gate** — present where the chapter's numerical core
  warrants a cross-language check (ch04 via `DifferentialEquations.jl`; ch05–07 and ch10–12 stdlib-only);
  absent by design elsewhere (ch14 and ch16 are filtering linear algebra + counting — JAX+torch only,
  per their briefs). A `—` in the Julia column is *not* a gap.
- **`claim-skeptic` is new (2026-06-04)** and has **not** been run retroactively on Ch 1–10; its adversarial
  math-claim pass is a forward gate (exercised on Ch 11–12, 14, and 16; on Ch 16 it confirmed all four
  propositions and drove the expected-vs-realized excess-CE distinction, a previously nonexistent
  companion check being added, and attribution tightenings — Zoology's recall-gap finding, the
  §14.5 axis-differentiation claim), so the Ch 1–10 rows do not yet reflect a claim-skeptic review.
- **Ch 13, 15, and 17** are `planned` stubs (no original prose/companions); the deployed pages show only the
  pre-release banner.

  printf 'ch%s status=%-12s jax=%s jul=%s tor=%s figs=%s\n' "$c" "$status" "$jax" "$jul" "$tor" "$figs"
done
```

Verification commands behind the columns: `make check` (CI gate), `make companion-jax-tests`,
`make companion-torch-tests`, `make companion-julia-tests` (local-only; need the uv `.venv`).
